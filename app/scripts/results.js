If getting &quot;exact&quot; is critical, please let us know at order so we can find the previous order documents and make sure we use the same machinist to engrave the order.

We suggest learning more if you have specific questions. Here are some helpful tips we found online (this is just a general summary of information and not meant to be complete):\r\n\r\n\u2022 As the barrels are a wood product, they are subject to the wood drying and shrinking.\r\n\u2022 In order for the spigot to flow freely, please remember to remove the bung\/cork before you open the spigot ... pour from the spigot ... then close the spigot and finally ... replace the bung\/cork. \r\n\u2022 To keep your barrels performing and looking their best, please keep them stored in a protected area away from the elements and optimally in a cool and relatively humid area. \r\n\u2022 Barrels with painted black steel hoops are particularly susceptible to moisture. A little care goes a long way. Prevent excessive staining and rust by keeping the exterior of the barrel dry.\r\n\u2022 Avoid water stains by using a funnel to carefully fill your new barrel. \r\n\u2022 Sandpaper will generally remove any stains or marks on the barrel. \r\n\u2022 As the barrels are handcrafted, liquid volume is approximate. \r\n\u2022 You should be able to reuse your barrel from 3-5 times ... remember that each aging will take longer than the previous one. \r\n\u2022 Please do not nail or put screws into the hoops or staves as doing so will compromise the oak and might cause damage. \r\n\u2022 If you want to age a different type of spirit then was initially aged in it, we recommend you use a new barrel. \r\n\u2022 For your safety, if using chemicals to clean\/sanitize your barrels, please follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for proper use.\r\n\u2022 The spirit can age anywhere from one week to one-year, but it&#39;s recommended that you take a small taste test every two weeks.  Remember to only take a small taste to ensure the top of the barrel does not get dry to avoid leaking and losing your spirit to the &#39;Angel&#39;s Share.&#39;  Once the spirit reaches your perfect taste, empty the spirit into a decanter and restart the process!\r\n\r\nAngel\u2019s Share.\r\nAngel\u2019s Share is a fancy name for evaporation. Since mini-barrel staves are thinner than normal distillery size 53-gallon barrel staves, there is a higher \u201cangel\u2019s share\u201d, thus higher evaporation. To avoid this evaporation, make sure you follow the instructions and 1) fill the barrel to the very top when first filling the barrel with your spirit; and 2) keep the top of the barrel moist after using the barrel by rolling the liquid around every couple of days. As previously mentioned, we recommend taking very small taste-tests every two weeks to ensure much of the top of the barrel does not become dry.&quot;\r\n\r\nStoring your Empty Barrel After Initial Use \r\nIdeally, your barrel would always be filled. Used barrels require no special preparation beyond a simple water rinse, if desired, when transferring out and in immediately. If used barrels are to be stored empty, rinse them several times with clean water, and drain thoroughly. Remove the spigot and bung to promote air flow and store out of sunlight and in a cool (55\u00b0 \u2013 60\u00b0) and optimally humid (65% - 75%) area. \r\n\r\nAn alternative is to fill and store barrels with a sulfur-citric holding solution (recipes are online). This holding solution promotes sanitation and keeps the barrels swelled and smelling sweet however ... it will strip some of the oaks flavors. For your safety and the safety of your family, always follow manufacturers\u2019 guidelines and instructions for the proper use of chemicals. \r\n\r\n","policy_seller_info":"Amy Werninger\r\n9 Stone Pound Lane\r\nAtkinson, NH 03811\r\nSummitEngraving@gmail.com","policy_updated_tsz":1446905693,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":true,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SummitEngravingLtd?utm_source=explorer&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/033\/0\/9052662\/iusb_760x100.14372376_mdth.jpg","num_favorers":794,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":null,"is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false}},{"listing_id":241617145,"state":"active","user_id":63414714,"category_id":68887494,"title":"Personalized Groomsmen gift set Engraved Glass Whiskey decanter 17 oz & 2 glasses Groom set Groomsman gift set Best men gift Groom gift","description":"This set includes 1 whiskey decanters & 2 glasses.\n\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nBUYING SET OF 5 OR MORE YOU GET A DISCOUNT AND SAVE ON SHIPPING\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\nSet of 5: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/ru\/listing\/244276757\/5-sets-personalized-groom-gift-glass?ref=shop_home_active_20\n\nSet of 6: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/ru\/listing\/241906638\/6-sets-personalized-glass-whiskey?ref=shop_home_active_10\n\nSet of 7: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/ru\/listing\/241906964\/7-sets-personalized-glass-whiskey?ref=shop_home_active_2\n\nSet of 8: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/ru\/listing\/241802551\/8-sets-personalized-glass-whiskey?ref=shop_home_active_4\n\nSet of 9: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/ru\/listing\/241802797\/9-sets-personalized-glass-whiskey?ref=shop_home_active_7\n\nSet of 10: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/ru\/listing\/241802905\/10-sets-personalized-glass-whiskey?ref=shop_home_active_6\n\nSet of 11: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/ru\/listing\/244236841\/11-sets-personalized-glass-whiskey?ref=shop_home_active_17\n\nSet of 12: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/ru\/listing\/244339564\/12-sets-personalized-glass-whiskey?ref=shop_home_active_16\n\n\nDecanter Specifications:\n\n- MELTING OF THE GLASS AND FORMING THE CARAFE IS MADE ON THE EQUIPMENT OF LEADING ITALIAN AND GERMAN MANUFACTURERS.

I will make the ring size you asked for, and accept no responsibility to offer an exchange or return if the customer orders the incorrect size. \r\n\r\nIf the wood, antler ring or carbon fiber you ordered ends up being slightly too small I can usually enlarge up to about a half size. Steel and silver rings can not be resized at all. \r\n\r\nMy goal is to ensure that your order is made exactly to your size specifications. Prior to placing your order please ensure that you have obtained the correct ring size. It is my expectation that you will order the size of ring that you need. I will make the size asked for but the responsibility is yours to get a proper sizing. I highly recommend getting sized at a jewellery store. \r\n\r\n***If the size you order ends up being too large or too small no refunds or exchanges will be offered. It is your responsibility to ensure you order the right size. However, if I make a sizing error I will re-do or re-size the ring for no cost.*** \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind each order is custom made by hand, and it takes just as much material and time to create another ring. However, if your ring ends up being only slightly too small I am able to enlarge it a little for a small fee (unless it has a stainless steel or silver lining). However, if the ring is much too small then I avoid resizing as it may compromise the integrity of the ring.\r\n\r\n***Stainless steel and silver lined rings can not be resized.***\r\n\r\nISSUES WITH APPEARANCE:\r\n\r\nBefore purchasing a ring please be advised that your ring will not look exactly the same as the one in the picture. Wood and Antler are natural materials and so each piece possesses its own unique grains and colours. Also Carbon Fiber is wrapped differently every time which can give it a slightly different pattern. However, this ensures your ring is absolutely unique, but it also makes it impossible for me to make the exact same ring twice. All I can do is make the ring you order with the exact same species of wood or antler used in the pictures. The resulting appearance of the wood or antler is beyond my control and no refund will be given in this regard. Thank you for your understanding in this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMAGE:\r\n\r\nCARBON FIBER RINGS -  These rings are highly durable. They are resistant to scratches and scuffs, are waterproof and can sustain heavy impacts. However, they are not indestructible so treat them fairly. Some of my carbon fiber rings also feature a layer of wood. The carbon fiber holds the wood firmly in place and keeps the water away from its edges. This reduces the risk of potential water damage greatly. However, the face of the wood is still exposed so some care should be take to minimize exposure to water and soaps\/sanitizers.\r\n\r\nWOOD AND ANTLER RINGS - The biggest determining factor regarding the longevity of your ring is you. Each ring is coated with a highly durable, water resistant finish known as cyanoacrylate (unless it is a silver lined ring, see info below). This is the same finish that is applied to wooden pens and other small wooden implements and is regarded as one of the best wooden finishes on the market. However, as with all wood finishes, it is subject to wear. Scratches on the surface or the loss of the glossy finish will not be covered by refunds or exchanges. See our FAQ section for tips on how to maintain your rings finish. \r\n\r\nSILVER LINED ANTLER RINGS -  These rings are left unfinished as antler is fairly resistant to water on its own, and there are no glued seems to worry about. This gives them a more natural feel. However, do not expose them to excessive moisture or soaps. Take them off if before doing dishes, showering, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOVERDUE ORDERS:\r\n\r\nI provide an up-to-date manufacturing time on my shop front page which varies based on the season. This time outlines the latest I will have your order shipped out from the date of purchase.\r\n\r\nThese timeframes can not account for any unforeseen delays like extreme illness or broken bones. It hasn&#39;t happened yet, but I do work with my hands for a living, so if I break a finger it may push ring production back a little. In the event that a situation like this arises please have patience. I will do my best to sort out these situations to suite both of our needs. \r\n\r\nCOVERAGE:\r\n\r\nMy rings are covered against breaks due to craftsmanship errors for up to 5 months. Accidental breaks caused by owner negligence are not covered. There are certain situations that wooden rings can not be expected to endure. See or FAQ section for some helpful tips regarding these. \r\n\r\n","policy_additional":"FAQ Section:\r\n\r\nQ: &quot;How long will it take for me to receive my ring?&quot;\r\n\r\nA: This is the most common question I get and the answer varies based on the time of year. I always have up-to-date info about my production time at the top of my shop front page, found here:  https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/ca\/shop\/Endeavours\r\n\r\n***Please note: Rings that feature metal are made in collaboration with my brother and so are dependent on his schedule as well. I can only make guarantees about production time for rings that don&#39;t involve metal because certain elements are out of my control. If some of his machinery breaks, or his electricity goes out for a couple days, this is out of my control and may delay the production times of the rings with metal in them. ***\r\n\r\nProduction time does not take into account shipping time. \r\n\r\nWITHIN CANADA: I ship using Canada Post&#39;s Xpresspost method. This comes with tracking, $100 insurance and a guaranteed 2 business days delivery time. (note: If delivery time is not met this must be taken up with Canada Post, not with me)\r\n\r\nUSA: I ship using Canada Post&#39;s Tracked Packet Method. This comes with a tracking number (to the border) and $100 insurance. It will arrive in an estimated 7 business days. (If there is a delay in delivery this must be taken up with Canada Post. I am not responsible for shipping times.)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL: Unless you pay additionally for a shipping upgrade international orders are sent as standard letter mail to keep costs down. These do not come with tracking or insurance and can take more than 15 business days to arrive. \r\n**If you need your ring to arrive sooner, I do have express shipping and manufacturing options available in my shop**\r\n\r\n***RINGS WITH SILVER LINING***\r\nMy rings that include the silver lining take longer than any other item in my workshop. These rings are the result of a collaboration between two workshops, as the metal inlay is done by another artist here in our city. Estimated completion time is about 6 weeks, but this cannot be guaranteed, as both workshop&#39;s schedules fluctuate depending on the business season. For up-to-date completion estimates please see product specific times in the silver lined rings item description. Please feel free to contact me further if you have a specific date in mind. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What is Carbon Fiber?\r\n\r\nA: Carbon Fiber is a marvel of the modern world. It essentially is composed of thousands and thousands of tiny strands which are much thinner than the hair on your head. When mixed with the proper solution these strands becomes inflexible and unbelievably strong, yet they remain extremely light. Carbon Fiber is frequently used in the automotive and aerospace industries and it makes for some amazing rings. \r\n\r\nQ: &quot;Why do you use wood and bone?&quot;\r\n\r\nA: The materials I use reflect my passion, fascination, and curiosity with nature. Wood and bone are two of the most versatile materials on Earth. They have been utilized for thousands of years by humankind. The process of working with these materials with my hands provides a primal joy unlike any other. Likewise, the end result is worn on our hands, providing a constant reminder of our intricate connection to this planet. \r\n\r\nI like to say that nature does most of the work for me; I simply bring out a beauty that was there all along. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: &quot;How do you take care of your rings?&quot;\r\n\r\nA: CARBON FIBER AND STEEL - These rings are waterproof and very strong. They can be worn in all situations. They resist scratching, but can become scuffed or scaped if metal rubs against them or other hard materials. Usually these scuffs can just be polished up with some 1000 grit sand paper. I can also re-polish them if there is a major scratch. \r\n\r\nWOOD AND ANTLER - The most important thing to remember is that these rings are not made of metal. However, if you are conscious of when and how you wear them there is no reason they can&#39;t last a lifetime. Here are a few tips for taking care of your ring:\r\n\r\n- Avoid harsh chemicals (including hand sanitizer!)\r\n- Minimize contact with any soap as it is difficult to predict how some of the chemicals may react with the finish. \r\n- Take off your ring before any heavy lifting or construction activity.\r\n- Avoid prolonged or continuous exposure to water. This means taking off your ring before showering, or soaking in water is recommended.\r\n- Avoid sharp impacts. \r\n\r\nYou may notice that the water resistant finish chips away from the antler sections of your ring more quickly than it does on the wood. This is due to material differences and fortunately is not a major concern. Antler does not require the same level of moisture protection that wood does and by continuing to follow our care instructions there should not be an issue with its integrity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: &quot;Are the rings with silver linings finished the same way?&quot;\r\n\r\nA: No they are not. Due to the steps involved in finishing a wood ring, I do not apply the cyanoacrylate finish to silver lined rings. Instead I infuse the antler or wood with resin using a special vacuum system. However, it does require special attention be paid to avoid excessive moisture contact. Take them off if your hands are going to be exposed to water. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: &quot;Can my ring be refinished after I have worn it for a while?&quot;\r\n\r\nA: Yes. I can re-apply the finish for you at any time for $30. This covers re-finishing as well as return shipping.\r\n\r\nYou may notice that the water resistant finish chips away from the antler sections of your ring more quickly than it does on the wood.

We were so lucky to find the wood we&#39;ve used to inlay into this band! The antique whiskey barrels were stored away in a local barn and we are so thankful we were able to salvage them. They were each marked &quot;Bourbon Whiskey - Illinois - 1971&quot; so the barrels are at least 40 years old. This charred oak whiskey barrel wood looks amazing inlaid into titanium! Perfect for either a man or a woman, this ring would make a really unique wedding ring or statement ring.\n\nAs always, this set is handcrafted by us in our home studio. We still make our rings one at a time, for the person ordering. We were one of the first to offer personalized and custom made titanium rings on Etsy and we still offer the same personalized service we always have.\n\nSizes Available: US 3- US 16 including half and quarter sizes\nWidths Available: 3\/16&quot;, 1\/4&quot;, 5\/16&quot;, 3\/8&quot;\nEngraving: Up to 20 characters per band\n\nPlease let us know your size, width, and engraving preferences for each band in the notes to seller box at checkout. If you are unsure of your size, we&#39;re glad to mail out a ring sizer free of charge with your paid order to help with fit. Just request a sizer in the notes to seller box at checkout. \n\nThis custom made titanium wedding band is perfect for a wedding, engagement, anniversary, commitment, handfasting, and more.\n\n--\n\nThis ring ships via Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation, and will arrive in a handcrafted tiny oak ring box suitable for gift giving. (Delivery Confirmation is not available for international orders.)\n\nPlease note that we don&#39;t keep our titanium wedding rings in stock but custom make each band to order. You can expect this process to take 3-4 weeks. Titanium rings are not resizable so please request a sizer if you&#39;re unsure of the best ring size.

We&#39;re Rob and Leighanne Thompson. We&#39;ve been making and selling our rings here on Etsy for nearly six years now, and we&#39;re looking forward to more great years here. We&#39;ve been married for 19 years and have seven children ages 8-17. We live on a small hobby farm in west Tennesse with our cocker spaniels and a small herd of dairy goats.  We strive to live a simple life (not always easy!) and enjoy gardening, renovating our 1940&#39;s farmhouse, and spending time with our kids.\r\n\r\nAll of our rings are made by us here, on our farm, in our studio. Our rings are still made the same way they were when we started out, one at a time, just for the person ordering. Whenever possible we use stabilized wood and add a water resistant coating for water resistance and durability, and do not charge extra for this. Our desire is to create beautiful, quality pieces at affordable prices. We are not a large company; our work force consists solely of the two of us.\r\n\r\nIf you send us a convo and we don&#39;t get right back to you, please send us another message!  We are mom and dad to seven and our household can get hectic at times =0).  We get so many messages that they can get buried fast, so if we don&#39;t get back with you, just contact us again.  Also, if you message us over the weekend, please be patient with us- if you don&#39;t hear from us on Saturday or Sunday, rest assured that we will reply to your messages on Monday morning. \r\n\r\n*Please Note* that we don&#39;t keep rings in stock.  Every band we make is crafted specifically for the person ordering it.  No two bands will be exactly alike because of our rings&#39; handmade nature.  There are times when we receive more orders than we can keep up with; when this happens, we will not hesitate to close down our shop so that we don&#39;t fall behind with our orders.\r\n\r\nAlso, (and we hate to have to even include this), but please, don&#39;t send us images of someone else&#39;s rings and ask us to make a design that isn&#39;t ours. While we are glad to take custom orders, we won&#39;t make someone else&#39;s design. We will not take on custom work when &quot;copies&quot; of other people&#39;s work are requested, no exceptions.","policy_payment":"We accept PayPal, credit card payments through PayPal, money orders,  personal checks, and cashiers&#39; checks.  Please pay promptly or convo us if you need help with payment.  If you are paying with an e check or personal check, we won&#39;t begin production of your band until payment clears. Also, if you mail in payment, please be sure to include shipping costs in your payment. If you need to cancel an order, please let us know within three days of placing your order as all of our work is custom and by hand.","policy_shipping":"Our wooden and corian bands ship domestically and internationally via First Class Mail.

We are also glad to insure your package for exact cost; just let us know if this is something you would like.\r\n\r\nInternational packages do NOT include tracking or Delivery Confirmation.International buyers are responsible for any duties or fees incurred when receiving their packages. Use this link to calculate any duties fees:\r\nwww.dutycalculator.com\/new-import-duty-and-tax-calculation\/","policy_refunds":"The nature of the materials we use most  are such that we can&#39;t resize our bands.  Sometimes we can make them just a bit bigger, but we can&#39;t make existing bands a lot bigger and we can never make them smaller.  Most of the time we have to start over with new rings.  Since a resize is actually a totally new ring, it takes just as much material, work, and time as the original. Therefore, if a band needs to be remade, we  ask for return of the original ring and 50% of the original cost just to cover our materials and part of our time.  Please note also that because resizing or exchanging involves making a new band from scratch that it will take our normal production time to get done.  If you&#39;re unsure of the size you need, please don&#39;t guess at it- let us know that you need some help and we can get some sizers sent out to you.  It is so much easier and better in the long run to take the time in the beginning and get the correct size made the first time around.  Note that we are glad to send sizers free of charge, but we ask that you place your order before we mail the sizer out to you. \r\n\r\nPlease note that our sizes are very presice and they do conform to international sizing specifications. \r\n\r\nIf we are able to make your ring larger, we are glad to do it. \r\n\r\nResizing or remaking a band will take time- at least a few days if we need to make an existing band a bit larger, and regular production time for a remake. \r\n\r\nWe will be happy to help if there are issues with your ring.  We will not refund the cost of the band because the band doesn&#39;t fit properly (unless the mis size is our fault) or if the buyer just changes their mind. We will also not refund the purchase price of a ring because the wood is not exactly as shown in the listing, etc. Wood is a natural material and we can never match color or grain exactly.","policy_additional":"FAQ\r\n\r\n-HOW DO I LET YOU KNOW MY SIZE, ETC? Let us know the size you need, any special requests (like engraving), and anything else you feel is important about your ring by using the drop down menu, and also in the notes to seller box of checkout. You should put everything you want us to know about your ring here. Convos after the fact are confusing for us and can make the production time of your ring longer. If you add information later on after purchase, we will do our best to make what you need but won&#39;t guarantee the changes. If you do not specify a size when you check out, we&#39;ll make you a standard size 8.\r\n\r\n-WHAT IS YOUR PRODUCTION TIME? Once we have all of the necessary information, expect your ring to take up to four weeks to make. Then please allow us time to package and ship your ring. A few things can delay or prolong your ring&#39;s production:\r\n-not paying promptly\r\n-not giving us a size \r\n-changing your size after we&#39;ve begun a different sized ring\r\n-changing the specifics of your ring after we&#39;ve begun it\r\n-extremely changing or customizing a ring&#39;s design\r\n-requesting materials for your ring that we don&#39;t keep in stock\r\n-not giving us all of the specifics about your ring in the notes to seller box of checkout\r\nWhile we are glad to give an estimated completion time for custom orders, we ask that you take our estimate as just that- an estimate. When we are making something totally custom, it can take longer than expected.\r\nAlso, if you contact us and ask us if we can complete a ring by a certain date, we will let you know if we can do it or not. If you wait a week or more after checking with us, we may or may not be able to complete your ring by the original deadline stated. If you have a deadline, please check with us before you order and remind us of it in the notes to seller box.\r\n\r\n-DO YOU OFFER ANY GUARANTEES ON YOUR RINGS? Yes, we do.  We will repair any damage to rings we make within 3 months of receiving the ring for no charge.  After this time, repair of wood inlays will cost $10.  Also, gemstone placement is guaranteed for three months as well.  Customer designed rings (ring styles that we don&#39;t normally offer in our shop but are made by special request) are not guaranteed at all.\r\n\r\n-CAN I SWIM\/BATHE\/SHOWER\/WASH MY HANDS WHILE WEARING A  WOOD RING? Our wood and wood inlay rings are quite durable and long lasting. Most of the varieties of wood we use are stabilized for water resistance, and all are given a  water resistant coating. We do not charge extra for this but do it as a matter of course, because we want everyone&#39;s band to be long lasting and durable. While this affords a huge amount of protection against water, over time the finish can be damaged. Therefore we suggest caution with water: dry your band well after getting it wet, and don&#39;t allow it to soak for long periods. Certain chemicals and solvents can be very hard on the finish as well. And as always, if your inlay is ever damaged, we can replace it for only $10 for as long as you own your ring. \r\n\r\n-I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT SIZE RING I WEAR... CAN YOU HELP ME?  Sure.  If you don&#39;t know what size ring you  need, we will be glad to mail you a ring sizer free of charge, after you purchase the style ring you would like. \r\n\r\n **If you get sized at a department store jewelry counter or another jeweler, we will not be responsible for mis sizes.  Unfortunately not all sizers and mandrels are created equally.  The best way to figure size if you really don&#39;t know is to get the sizers sent =0).**\r\n\r\n-CAN YOU DO HALF AND QUARTER SIZES?  Yes, we can do half and quarter sizes. \r\n\r\n-CAN YOU CUSTOMIZE A RING FOR ME? OR USE A DIFFERENT STONE\/WOOD\/METAL?  Yes, in most cases.  We&#39;ll definitely do what we can to make just what you&#39;re looking for.  Just convo us with what you&#39;d like us to make and we&#39;ll let you know if it&#39;s something we can do. Also, once you&#39;ve discussed a custom band with us and you order, please remember to put any special requests and changes in the notes to seller section of checkout- it helps us tremendously to have all of the information we need in one place.  We reserve the right to photograph and use custom designs for future sales and listings.\r\n\r\n-CAN YOU ENGRAVE YOUR RINGS? Yes, we can.  Engraving costs $10 and there are seperate listings for it in our shop. The character limit, including spaces, is 20 characters. You must purchase a listing for engraving and let us know the engraving you need in the notes to seller box when you check out. We can no longer offer this service for free, but we&#39;re working to keep it as affordable as possible.\r\n\r\n-HOW DO I CONTACT YOU?  Through Etsy conversations only, please.  This is the best way to make sure that we see your message in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n-I ORDERED A RING AND IT&#39;S GREAT, BUT I ORDERED THE WRONG SIZE... CAN YOU RESIZE IT?   The nature of the materials we use most  are such that we can&#39;t resize our bands.  Sometimes we can make them just a bit bigger, but we can&#39;t make existing bands a lot bigger and we can never make them smaller.  Most of the time we have to start over with new rings.  Since a resize is actually a totally new ring, it takes just as much material, work, and time as the original. Therefore, if a band needs to be remade, we  ask for return of the original ring and 50% of the original cost just to cover our materials and part of our time.  Please note also that because resizing or exchanging involves making a new band from scratch that it will take our normal production time to get done.  If you&#39;re unsure of the size you need, please don&#39;t guess at it- let us know that you need some help and we can get some sizers sent out to you.  It is so much easier and better in the long run to take the time in the beginning and get the correct size made the first time around.  Note that we are glad to send sizers free of charge, but please only request them if you intend, seriously, to purchase a band from our shop (so that we can keep these sizers free for those who need them =0).)\r\n\r\n-MY RING DOESN&#39;T LOOK LIKE THE ONE IN THE LISTING.  WHAT DID YOU DO WRONG AND HOW CAN YOU FIX IT?  Wood is organic and there is no way we can duplicate an exact grain pattern or color from ring to ring- it can vary quite a bit in even the same small piece of wood.  Understand that, like snowflakes, no two pieces of wood are exactly alike (the same is true of our random mokume pattern- we just can&#39;t recreate the pattern in the picture exactly.) Also, every ring we make is handmade- we don&#39;t have any sort of assembly line set up and there are going to be tiny differences from ring to ring just because we *can&#39;t* make rings exactly alike with our current production methods. Embrace this and be happy to know that no one else in the whole world has a ring just like yours =0).\r\n\r\n-CAN WE MEET YOU IN PERSON TO DISCUSS COMMISSIONING A RING?  Yes, although we will still work the sale through Etsy.  We have met a lot of wonderful Etsy folks from all over the country, and we&#39;re always glad to make time for this.  Just let us know when you need to meet so that we can plan accordingly.  \r\n\r\n-CAN WE TOUR YOUR STUDIO?  Yes, if you will give us time to plan accordingly =0). We do have seven kids and they tend to get a little messy- we need time to control the chaos before visitors arrive, so just let us know so that we can plan (and clean like mad, lol.)\r\n\r\n-CAN TITANIUM BE CUT OFF IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY?  In most cases, yes.  It&#39;s a myth that titanium is so hard that it can&#39;t be cut off in emergency room situations (although some grades are actually too hard to cut, the ones we use aren&#39;t and we cut both commercially pure and aerospace titanium daily with the simplest of tools and no problems)... however, we can&#39;t be held responsible if the unthinkable happens and for misinformed ER workers.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1448982521,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":"Rings by Rob and Lean is on vacation!

Once items leave the US they are no longer the shop&#39;s responsibility. Customs in your country may charge a fee and will be buyer\u2019s responsibility and will not be paid by Southern Girl Apparel. Please check on your country&#39;s customs rates before purchase.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE that for international shipments, there may be unexpected delays if your package is held at customs. We have no control over shipments after they leave our hands. Buyers are responsible for any import duties imposed by their country of residence. All orders shipped internationally through Etsy include the full purchase price on the customs form.\r\n\r\nSTOLEN AFTER DELIVERY or UNDELIVERABLE DUE TO SHIPPING ADDRESS PROVIDED ON ETSY: Refunds or replacements will *not* be issued for merchandise that has been &quot;delivered&quot; to your requested address, according to the USPS tracking number, but you claim you never received it. I am not responsible for your stolen mail, and will not provide a replacement at my expense or a refund for your missing goods. You can request a signature confirmation at delivery for an additional $2.20 USD. Also, partial refunds (minus original shipping) are issued when an order is returned to me because a delivery attempt was made and a notice was left, but the buyer did not pick up the package or arrange a re-delivery for whatever reason, or an incorrect address was provided by the buyer on Etsy. If you choose to have me re-ship the product back to you, it will be AT YOUR EXPENSE -- no exceptions. \r\n\r\n*PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE check your ADDRESS in ETSY prior to purchasing. I ship your purchase to your Etsy address. Sometimes, Etsy will try to add a &quot;Street&quot;, &quot;Terr&quot; or &quot;Drive&quot; to your address. I DO NOT alter your shipping address. Please understand there may be a shipping delay if you do not include the full address as USPS considers this an &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; shipping address. If you realize your address is incorrect after purchase, please convo me ASAP to avoid a delay in shipping and\/or not receiving your purchase* \r\n\r\nORDERS LOST IN TRANSIT: In the event that a US order is *lost in transit* by the US Postal Service and has not arrived in 45 days, as verified by the tracking information, you will be offered a refund minus the original shipping charges. I am not responsible for orders listed as &#39;delivered&#39; that are stolen after delivery (see details above). If your international order has not arrived in 45 days, it is likely lost or stolen. I am not responsible for lost or stolen international orders where I can guarantee the box was shipped by providing you with a shipping receipt on paper.

So, let me bake for you - enjoy - indulge !\r\n\r\nABOUT WHY WEIGHT BARS\r\nI have been using Garcinia Cambogia in my Why Weight Bars since 2007 and this is the first time it has been given credit on national T.V. FYI watch the attached video.\r\nMake the most of your time and do something good for yourself. Raise the bar on weight  with the power of our Acai Berry Brownie Bars!\r\n\r\nCurb the urge to snack between meals, get a stamina boost, look good and feel even better. Saving the world just got slimmer, trimmer and sexier!\r\n\r\nAcai Berries Suppress Appetite\r\n\r\nThe hardest part of living a healthy lifestyle is resisting the temptations to eat those tasty snacks. The Acai Berry is rich in fiber and omega 6 & 9 fats promoting a healthy metabolism. This is an all natural solution to temper those little snack cravings between meals.\r\n\r\nAcai Berry is a Natural Energy Booster\r\n\r\nUnlike energy drinks or pills that are filled with caffeine and dangerous chemicals, the Acai Berry is 100% natural. Increased energy is one of its most noted side effects and the benefits are not negated by a crash (like energy drinks) that makes you feel worse than before you took it.\r\n\r\nIncrease Metabolism with the Acai Berry\r\n\r\nStudies have shown a direct link to the Acai Berry and an increase in your body\u2019s metabolic rate. This speeds up caloric burn and flushes the toxins that decrease energy and make you feel bloated.\r\n\r\nOne of the coolest aspects of this however is that Acai is a natural and organic product so unlike the synthetic lab created products you see advertised on TV and in magazines, Acai will keep your metabolism running strong all day without any of the jittery side effects!\r\n\r\nFat Fighting Fiber\r\n\r\nWhen fiber is eaten it swells in the stomach creating a filling quality. The body must work harder to digest high fiber foods, which speeds up the metabolism and burns calories faster.\r\n\r\nIt also acts as a digestive cleanser which helps in the removal of fat before your body can absorb it.\r\n\r\nThe Bottom Line\r\n\r\nYou will be hard pressed to find a better product on the market then Acai Berry to aid in fast, effective, and healthy weight .\r\n\r\nNow you too can enjoy the wonderful baked goods here on Etsy without feeling guilty about taking in those extra calories. Enjoy along with them, my wholesome Why Weight Bars with Acai Berry and Brindle Berries, Super Fruit and made with Gluten Free Grains and Organic Fruits and Nuts.Just 1 per day for less than the cost of an energy bar from your local gas station. \r\n\r\nYou will notice from the photos of the already baked bars, that they have a purplish cast to them. I mention this because I know you have a great sense of color here on Etsy. The cast is coming from the ground Acai pulp and there is quite a bit in each batch. Acai berries are pictured above and the richer and  fresher they are, the blacker they are. I use Acai in everything I make with the exception of the children&#39;s bars. It is a Super Duper Fruit.\r\n\r\nThey are made to order in my licensed and inspected kitchen and have at least  a 60 day shelf life because they are Vegan and there are no animal products of any kind in them to spoil\r\n. Remember to drink lots of water with your bar to get the nutrients into your system. Green tea is wonderful too, as a companion product for these bars. The more water or Green tea, the better.  We recommend that your bars be stored in a cool dry location. \r\nNuff said!\r\nThank you again and if you have any questions at all, please give me a holler.    \r\n                                                                                                                  Janet Best                    \r\n","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":"I am catching up on orders for the holidays and have to take a break from selling until II am ahead .
